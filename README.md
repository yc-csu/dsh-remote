> ### ⚠️ This repository is a modified build (fork)
>
> It is a modification of [flymysql/dsh-remote](https://github.com/flymysql/dsh-remote) (MIT, Copyright © 2026 dsh-remote contributors) at version **0.5.4** — it is **not** the upstream release.
>
> **Upstream has moved far ahead**: 0.8.x ships 21 `rw_*` tools, port forwarding, better-sidebar remote editing, an audit log and keychain passwords. Prefer upstream if you want the complete/latest feature set:
> `dsh plugin --profile <profile> add github:flymysql/dsh-remote`.
>
> Extra **GUI features** in this build (on top of 0.5.4):
>
> - **File-manager window** — upload / download / rename / delete / mkdir from the UI (`/dsh-remote/{list,home,upload,download,fs}`)
> - **Interactive terminal window** — xterm.js + WebSocket PTY, with the xterm assets self-hosted by the plugin (`/dsh-remote/assets/*`, no CDN)
> - **Floating windows** — both the terminal and the file manager can be dragged / resized / minimised
> - **Guard mode** — high/low autonomy for remote mutations plus approval gating (`/dsh-remote/guard`, `/remote-guard`)
> - **Image viewer** — preview remote images inside the terminal window
> - **Single-slot conflict fix** — both directory-flow SINGLE slots now register at `priority: -110` (was `-100`, which collides with `@dsh-external/dsh-webui` and kills one plugin's whole client entry)
>
> ⚠️ This plugin therefore **cannot be enabled together** with upstream `dsh-remote` / `dsh-ssh-remote` (the 10 `rw_*` tool names are identical → `tool "..." is already registered`).

# dsh-remote

**Remote-work assistant for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH).**

Manage several SSH machines, then pick a **remote workspace** (or a **local** one) and let the agent operate right there without leaving the harness — listing files, reading code, running builds & commands over the remote host, and keeping that remote directory mirrored into a real local workspace object.

The harness Web UI intentionally binds `127.0.0.1` (the CLI rejects `--host 0.0.0.0` for safety). This plugin goes the other way: **you connect out** to the machines you maintain, pick a workspace, and work in it through the normal DSH workspace + agent fs flows — no changes to `dsh-workspace` or the harness core.

## Screen previews

Settings → **远程工作区** — a multi-machine SSH registry (add / edit / delete / set-current, password stored locally):

The native **"Add workspace" / "Select workspace"** flow — a centered modal, two tabs, opens on **本机 (local)**; switch to **远程 (remote)**:

- **远程** — a **machine `<select>`**, a path field that **auto-prefills `/` and live-completes** directories (picking one immediately reveals its next level, OS/VSCode-style), plus a **浏览…** floating browser that fills the field without committing — you review, edit, then **设为远程工作区**.

Real capture (host scrubbed to a placeholder):

## Features

- **Multi-machine SSH** — save any number of hosts (`host`/`port`/`user` + **private key** or **password**). Passwords are stored locally and never shown back in the UI. Switch with one click in Settings.
- **Two-tab workspace picker** (fills the native "Add workspace" flow):
  - **本机 / Local** — opens the **native OS folder chooser** over the host, or lets you type a local path → adopted directly as a normal DSH local workspace (local workspaces fully coexist).
  - **远程 / Remote** — the picker is a **centered modal** (never squeezed into a narrow sidebar). Pick a **machine** → the path field is **pre-filled with `/`** and live **autocompletes** directories; **selecting a directory immediately lists its next level** (OS/VSCode-style cascade). A **浏览…** floating browser (opaque, height-capped, scrollable, follows symlinks) fills the field without committing — you review, edit, then confirm. On confirm it creates a **real local mirror** (`~/.dsh/remote-workspaces/<host>/<base>-<hash>`) that passes `fs.realpath` → the harness adopts it as a real workspace while dsh-remote keeps it synced over SFTP.
- **Bidirectional SFTP sync** — `rw_sync` (remote → mirror) and `rw_push` (mirror → remote) round-trip your local-mirror edits back to the machine.
- **Model tools** — `rw_info`, `rw_connect`, `rw_pick_workspace`, `rw_list_dir`, `rw_read_file`, `rw_write_file`, `rw_exec`, `rw_sync`, `rw_push`, `rw_disconnect`.
- **Write directly to a remote file** — `rw_write_file` creates or overwrites a remote file (making parent directories), so you don't have to round-trip through a local mirror for a single-file edit.
- **Connection health** — a **「测试连接」 test-connection** button in the Settings page validates host/user/key/password before you save a machine.
- The active `user@host:/path` is injected into every system prompt so the agent knows its working root.
- **No official `dsh-workspace` core is modified** — everything is delivered as a normal plugin (directory-flow holes filled by the client half at `priority -100`).

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin add dsh-remote            # add the bundle
```

(or `npm install dsh-remote` + add `- id: dsh-remote / name: dsh-remote` in `cordis.patch.yml`).

## Quick start

1. **Add a machine** — Settings → 远程工作区 → add host/port/user + key or password → (optional) set it current.
2. **Open a workspace** — click **Add workspace** in the sidebar / conversation:
   - **本机** → system folder chooser (or type a local path) → local workspace.
   - **远程** → choose the machine → browse to a remote directory (or type `/path`) → "设为远程工作区" ⇒ a local mirror workspace is created and adopted.
3. **Work with the agent** — treat it like any workspace:
   - `rw_list_dir(path?)`/`rw_read_file` — inspect remote files
   - `rw_write_file(path, content)` — create or overwrite a remote file directly
   - `rw_exec(command)` — run remote shell commands
   - `rw_sync` / `rw_push` — pull/push the local mirror to and from the remote

## CLI defaults (optional)

Provide a default machine in `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
# Example only — use values for your own machine.
- id: dsh-remote
  name: dsh-remote
  config:
    host: 203.0.113.10   # or your real host / hostname
    port: 22
    username: dev
    privateKeyPath: ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    # or password: '…'
    workspace: ~/project
```

If `host` is empty the plugin starts disconnected and you configure machines in the UI.

## CLI quick reference

Installing and driving DSH may live in different shells, so both the `dsh` binary and the `npx` form are shown. Always tell DSH **which profile** to use with `--profile <name>` (usually `web`).

```bash
# install the bundle into a profile (npm is pulled by pnpm; recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-remote
# same but when `dsh` is not on PATH (e.g. Windows PowerShell inside a repo)
npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-remote

# confirm it is installed wire
dsh plugin --profile web list
npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web list

# start the web surface (reload profile; the plugin activates on boot)
dsh --profile web
npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh --profile web   # http://127.0.0.1:3080

# use a local checkout instead of the npm version (dev iteration)
npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-remote
npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-remote   # back to release
```

After a successful start, `Settings → 远程工作区` appears and the "Add workspace" flow gains the 本机 / 远程 tabs (screenshots above).

## Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `host` | string | `''` | default SSH host (else start disconnected) |
| `port` | int | `22` | default SSH port |
| `username` | string | `''` | default SSH user |
| `password` | string | `''` | default SSH password (non-empty overrides key) |
| `privateKeyPath` | string | `''` | private key path (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` when empty) |
| `workspace` | string | `''` | default remote workspace path |
| `commandTimeoutMs` | int | 20000 | per remote command timeout |
| `connectTimeoutMs` | int | 15000 | SSH connect timeout |

## Safety

Giving the plugin a machine's credentials lets the agent run **shell commands as your user** on that host. Only add machines you trust. Passwords are saved on the local machine file; treat it as sensitive (you may lock file ACLs).
